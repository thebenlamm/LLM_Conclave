Please implement Phase 2 (Tracking & Metrics):\n\n  1. Create ConsultLogger (src/utils/ConsultLogger.ts)\n     - Log consultations to ~/.llm-conclave/consult-logs/\n     - Save both JSON (full result) and Markdown (summary)\n     - Create monthly index files (index-YYYY-MM.json)\n     - Track: id, timestamp, question, duration, cost, confidence\n\n  2. Create consult-stats command (src/commands/consult-stats.ts)\n     - CLI: llm-conclave consult-stats [options]\n     - Options: --month YYYY-MM, --week, --all-time\n     - Display dashboard with:\n       - Usage metrics (total consultations, active days, avg per day)\n       - Performance metrics (p50, p95, p99 response times)\n       - Cost metrics (total cost, avg per consultation, total tokens)\n     - Format: ASCII table with emojis (✅ ⚡ 💰 🎯)\n\n  3. Integrate ConsultLogger into consult command\n     - Auto-log every consultation result\n     - Ensure logs directory is created\n\n  4. Register consult-stats command in index.ts\n\n  Key constraints:\n  - Log directory: ~/.llm-conclave/consult-logs/\n  - Index format: { month: \"YYYY-MM\", consultations: [...] }\n  - Stats should read all JSON logs and compute metrics\n  - Dashboard should be readable and actionable\n\n  Start with ConsultLogger implementation. Test by running a consultation and verifying logs are created."}
