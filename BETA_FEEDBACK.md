### llm_conclave_discuss - DB constraint decision

- **Tool used:** llm_conclave_discuss
- **Personas:** architect, pragmatic, security
- **Task:** DB constraint vs env var flexibility decision
- **Result quality:** 4/5 stars - reached consensus quickly with clear rationale
- **Response time:** Fast (~2s)
- **Issues:** None
- **Suggestions:** Would be nice to see the full reasoning without needing to read the log file

**Potential improvement:** Add `--verbose` or `--show-reasoning` flag to include agent reasoning in terminal output instead of only in log files.
